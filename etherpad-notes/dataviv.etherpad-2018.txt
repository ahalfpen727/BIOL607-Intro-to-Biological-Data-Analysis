Data Visualization     9/17/2018

four principles: clarity, precision- easy to see the answer/meaning?, efficiency (what's the cognitive load) and max ideas with minimal ink 
gg: grammar of graphics 

colorbrewer.org - variety of color scales - print friendly, colorblind safe, etc 

One cool wind visualization: https://embed.windy.com


q-q plots: theoretical vs observed quantiles
polar coordinate system useful for sinusoidal patterns
Think about redundant coding for plots (e.g. using color and separate time scale plots)


For color choosing:

Can't import .xlsx file into R - use text or .csv files. **When saving as a .csv, it will only save the worksheet you are currently working on and delete all other worksheets. Therefore, always save raw data file separately before applying any statistical analyses.
Date formats in excel do not work well in R
Avoid spaces and periods between words in files (use underscore)
Data analysis in Excel is not reproducible 
Text wrangler program - works well with R. Use text editor program while transforming/reorganizing data.
Camelcase may be a better option than underscores for column headers
Can use "data validation" in Excel (under data tab) to prevent errors in data entry (quality control). Also can use 'conditional formatting' (under format tab).
