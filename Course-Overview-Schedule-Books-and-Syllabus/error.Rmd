```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We all run into error messages. In class, during a homework, during an exam. This is a page with an embedded etherpad. You can work on it here, or at https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/607-error-messages if you would prefer.

For each error:  

0) State who you are
1) Report the error message.  
2) Make a reproducible example that generates the error.
3) Provide any additional comments.  
4) Email the class that you have put up a new error (or email jarrett.byrnes@umb.edu and I'll forward your notice).
5) Once you answer an error, put your name by it. +1 point on your exam per error message troubleshot.

See the example at the top as a template.
