    1. R Warmup

    *1a.* Create a vector of 100 randomly distributed numbers between 0
and 100 using |runif| and save the vector into the variable |my_vec|. If you cannot figure out runif, try |?runif|. What information does |str| and |summary| tell you about |my_vec|? How do they differ?

    *1b*. Try out a little plot. What does |hist(my_vec)| show you? What information does the helpfile for |hist| tell you about what you just did?

    *1c.* Load up the |mtcars| data set using |data(mtcars)|. Apply the following functions to mtcars: |class|, |str|, |summary|. What do these three functions tell you about mtcars?

    *1d* Look at the help file for the class |data.frame|. What does it tell you about these objects?


    2. Sample Properties

Consider the following vasopressin levels in voles.

|vole_vaso <- c(98,96,94,88,86,82,77,74,70,60,
           59,52,50,47,40,35,29,13,6,5)|

    *2a.* Say “Vole vasopressin” 10 times as fast as you can. How many
times did you trip up?

    *2b.* What is the mean, median, sd, and interquartile range of the
sample?

    *2c*. What is the standard error of the mean (do this with a formula!)?

    *2d.* What does the standard error of the mean tell you about our
estimate of the mean values of the population of vole vassopressin?


    3. Sample Size for upper quartiles.

We can get the upper quartile value of vole vassopressin with

|quantile(vole_vaso, probs = 0.75)|

Let’s assume the sample is representative of the popultion.

    *3a*. Use |sample()| to get just one resample with a sample size of 10. What is its upper
quartile?

    *3b.* Build an initial data frame for simulations with the sample
sizes 5 through 20. Have 100 simulations per sample size.

    *3c.* Use this data frame to get simulated upper quartiles for each
sample size.

    *3d.* With a plot, make a guesstimate as to the best sample size for
estimating the upper quartile of the population.


    4. SE and CI

    *4a.* With the upper quartile simulations, calculate the SD for each
sample size using |dplyr|

    *4b.* What does this value, the standard error of the upper
quartile, mean?

    *4c.* What is the CI of the upper quartile with a sample size of 10.
What does this mean?

    *4d.* Extra Credit: Instead of having each sim calculate a upper
quartile, and then sifting down to the SE of that upper quartile (or the
CI), have each simulation calculate a CI. Then, for just a sample size
of 10, how many CI’s contain the true value of 83?
