## New methods

Hover over a function argument for a short description of its meaning.  The variable names are plucked from the examples further below.

**Paired $t$-test** and **95% confidence interval** of a mean difference:

> t.test(<u><a title="A numerical variable (vector) measured on all individuals.">blackbird\$logAfterImplant</a></u>, <u><a title="A numerical variable (vector) measured on the same individuals as the previous variable.">blackbird\$logBeforeImplant</a></u>, <u><a title="This stipulates that the two variables you provided are paired (if left out, R carries out a two-sample test instead because paired = FALSE is the default).">paired = TRUE</a></u>)

**Two-sample $t$-test** and **95% confidence interval** for a difference between two means:

> t.test(<u><a title="The '~' indicates that this argument is a formula. squamosalHornLength is the response variable. Survival is the explanatory variable, indicating to which group each response measurement belongs (alive or dead in this example).">squamosalHornLength ~ Survival</a></u>, <u><a title="The name of the data frame containing the two variables.">data = lizard</a></u>, <u><a title="Specifies that the variance is assumed to be equal in the two groups in an ordinary two-sample t-test. Set var.equal = FALSE (the default) if you want a Welch's t-test instead.">var.equal = TRUE</a></u>)

**Other new methods:**

 * The $F$ test to compare two variances.
 * The 95% confidence interval for the variance ratio.
 * Leveneâ€™s test to compare variances between two (or more) groups.

## Example 12.2. [Red-winged blackbirds](http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter12/chap12e2BlackbirdTestosterone.csv)

*__Confidence interval for mean difference__ and the __paired t-test__, comparing immunocompetence of red-winged blackbirds before and after testosterone implants.*

**Read the data into a data frame.** The data are in "wide" format (one row per individual).

```{r}
blackbird <- read.csv(url("http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter12/chap12e2BlackbirdTestosterone.csv"))
blackbird
```

**Calculate and plot differences (Figure 12.2-2).** We add a variable called `d` to the data frame with the After minus Before difference.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
blackbird$d <- blackbird$logAfterImplant - blackbird$logBeforeImplant
head(blackbird)
hist(blackbird$d, right = FALSE, col = "firebrick")
```

To see how to produce the **strip chart with lines (Figure 12.2-1)**:

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# It helps to obtain a version of the data in "long" format.
blackbird2 = reshape(blackbird, varying = 4:5, direction = "long", idvar = "blackbird", v.names = "logAntibody", times = factor(c("before","after"), levels = c("before","after")))
head(blackbird2)

par(bty="l")
stripchart(logAntibody ~ time, data = blackbird2, vertical = TRUE, xlab = "Implant treatment", ylab="Antibody production rate (ln[mOD/min])", xlim = c(0.6,2.4), las = 1, pch = 16, col = "firebrick")
segments(1, blackbird$logBeforeImplant, 2, blackbird$logAfterImplant)
```

**95% confidence interval for the mean difference.** 95% confidence intervals are part of the output of the `t.test` function, viewed in isolation by adding `$conf.int` to the command.

```{r}
t.test(blackbird$d)$conf.int
```

or using the `paired = TRUE` argument of `t.test` and specifying the paired variables.

```{r}
t.test(blackbird$logAfterImplant, blackbird$logBeforeImplant, paired = TRUE)$conf.int
```

**Paired t-test.** A paired $t$-test can be done either on differences you have already calculated (`d` here) or by using the `paired=TRUE` argument with the measurements from the two groups.

```{r}
t.test(blackbird$d)
```

or

```{r}
t.test(blackbird$logAfterImplant, blackbird$logBeforeImplant, paired = TRUE)
```

## Example 12.3. [Horned lizards](http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter12/chap12e3HornedLizards.csv)

*__Confidence interval for the difference between two means__, and the __two-sample $t$-test__, comparing horn length of live and dead (spiked) horned lizards.*

```{r}
lizard <- read.csv(url("http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter12/chap12e3HornedLizards.csv"))
lizard
```

Note that there is one missing value for the variable `squamosalHornLength`. Everything is easier if we eliminate the row with missing data.

```{r}
lizard2 <- na.omit(lizard)
lizard2
```

**Multiple histograms** using the lattice package.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
library(lattice)
histogram( ~ squamosalHornLength | Survival, data = lizard2, layout = c(1,2), col = "firebrick", breaks = seq(12, 32, by = 2), xlab = "Horn length (mm)")
```

Here is code to make multiple histograms using `hist` in base R instead.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
oldpar = par(no.readonly = TRUE) # make backup of default graph settings
par(mfrow = c(2,1), oma = c(4, 6, 2, 6), mar = c(3, 4, 3, 2))
hist(lizard2$squamosalHornLength[lizard2$Survival == "living"], breaks = seq(12,32,by=2), col = "firebrick", las = 1, main = "living", ylab = "Frequency")
hist(lizard2$squamosalHornLength[lizard2$Survival == "killed"], breaks = seq(12,32,by=2), col = "firebrick", las = 1, main = "killed", ylab = "Frequency")
mtext("Horn length (mm)", side = 1, outer = TRUE, padj = 0)
par(oldpar) # revert to default graph settings
```

**95% confidence interval for the difference between means**

The output of `t.test` includes the 95% confidence interval for the difference between means. Add `$confint` after calling the function to get R to report only the confidence interval. The formula in the following command tells R to compare `squamosalHornLength` between the two groups indicated by `Survival`.

```{r}
t.test(squamosalHornLength ~ Survival, data = lizard, var.equal = TRUE)$conf.int
```

**A two-sample $t$-test** of the difference between two means can be carried out with `t.test` by using a formula, asking if `squamosalHornLength` is predicted by `Survival`, and specifying that the variables are in the data frame `lizard`.

```{r}
t.test(squamosalHornLength ~ Survival, data = lizard, var.equal = TRUE)
```

## Example 12.4. [Salmon survival with brook trout](http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter12/chap12e4BrookTrout.csv)

*__Welch's two-sample t-test for unequal variances__, comparing chinook salmon survival in the presents and absence of brook trout. Below, we use this same example to demonstrate the __95% confidence interval for the ratio of two variances__, and the __F-test of equal variances__.*

Read the data.

```{r}
chinook <- read.csv(url("http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter12/chap12e4ChinookWithBrookTrout.csv"))
```

Set the preferred order of categories in tables and graphs

```{r}
chinook$troutTreatment <- factor(chinook$troutTreatment, levels = c("present", "absent"))
```

**Strip chart of the data** (bare bones version of Figure 12.4-1)

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
stripchart(proportionSurvived ~ troutTreatment, data = chinook, method = "jitter", vertical = TRUE)
```

Adding the means and confidence intervals to the plot is trickier. Code for a fancier plot is as follows.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# Calculate means and confidence intervals for the means.
meanProportion = tapply(chinook$proportionSurvived, chinook$troutTreatment, mean)
ciPresence = t.test(chinook$proportionSurvived[chinook$troutTreatment == "present"])$conf.int
ciAbsence = t.test(chinook$proportionSurvived[chinook$troutTreatment == "absent"])$conf.int
lower = c(ciPresence[1], ciAbsence[1])
upper = c(ciPresence[2], ciAbsence[2])

# Stripchart with options
adjustAmount = 0.2
par(bty = "l") 
stripchart(proportionSurvived ~ troutTreatment, data = chinook, vertical = TRUE,method = "jitter", jitter = 0.1, pch = 1, col = "firebrick", cex = 1.5, las = 1, ylim = c(0, max(chinook$proportionSurvived)), lwd = 1.5, xlab = "Trout treatment", ylab = "Proportion surviving")
segments( c(1,2) + adjustAmount, lower, c(1,2) + adjustAmount, upper)
points(meanProportion ~ c( c(1,2) + adjustAmount ), pch = 16, cex = 1.2)
```

**Calculating summary statistics by group** (as found in Table 12.4-3)

Use `tapply` to calculate statistics by group. It has three required arguments. The first is the numeric variable of interest (a vector). The second argument is a categorical variable (a vector of the same length) identifying the groups that individuals belong to. The third argument is the name of the R function that you want to apply to the variable by group.

```{r}
meanProportion <- tapply(chinook$proportionSurvived, chinook$troutTreatment, mean)
sdProportion <-   tapply(chinook$proportionSurvived, chinook$troutTreatment, sd)
nProportion <-    tapply(chinook$proportionSurvived, chinook$troutTreatment, length)
data.frame(mean = meanProportion, std.dev = sdProportion, n = nProportion)
```

**Welch's two-sample $t$-test** of means for unequal variances can also be done with `t.test`, when the `var.equal` argument is set to `FALSE` (as it is by default):

```{r}
t.test(proportionSurvived ~ troutTreatment, data = chinook, var.equal = FALSE)
```

*Here, we demonstrate the __95% confidence interval for the ratio of two variances__, and __F-test of equal variances__, using the chinook salmon experiment.*

**95% confidence interval for variance ratio.** (Warning: remember that the method is not robust to departures from assumption of normality.)

```{r}
var.test(proportionSurvived ~ troutTreatment, data = chinook)$conf.int
```

**$F$-test** of equal variances (Warning: Remember that the $F$-test is not robust to departures from assumption of normality.)

```{r}
var.test(proportionSurvived ~ troutTreatment, data = chinook)
```

**Levene's test** of equal variances. This function is in the `car` package, which must first be installed and loaded with the library function before use.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if (!require("car")) {install.packages("car", dependencies = TRUE, repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")}
library(car)
leveneTest(chinook$proportionSurvived, group = chinook$troutTreatment, center = mean)
```
